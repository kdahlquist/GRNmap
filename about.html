    A gene regulatory network (GRN) consists of genes, transcription factors, and the regulatory connections between them that govern the level of expression of mRNA and proteins from those genes. The dynamics of a GRN is how gene expression in the network changes over time. GRNmap (Gene Regulatory Network modeling and parameter estimation) uses ordinary differential equations to model the dynamics of small- to medium-scale GRNs.  Using a penalized least squares approach, GRNmap estimates production rates, expression thresholds, and regulatory weights for each transcription factor in the network based on timecourse gene expression data (typically generated by DNA microarrays, but amenable to data from other technologies), and then performs a forward simulation of the dynamics of the network.  Our approach is described in the paper, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0092-6/fulltext.html" target="_blank">Dahlquist, K.D., Fitzpatrick, B.G., Camacho, E.T., Entzminger, S.D., and Wanner, N.C. (2015) Parameter Estimation for Gene Regulatory Networks from Microarray Data: Cold Shock Response in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. <i>Bulletin of Mathematical Biology</i>, 77(8), 1457-1492, DOI: 10.1007/s11538-015-0092-6.</a>  Although a GRN from budding yeast was modeled in that paper, GRNmap can be used with any species.  Besides what is described in that paper, GRNmap now has an option to use a Michaelis-Menten production function as well as the sigmoidal production function, the ability to input replicate expression data instead of the means for each timepoint, and the option to include data for experiments in which a transcription factor was deleted from the network, among others.

    GRNmap is a project of the <a href="http://www.lmu.edu/" target="_blank">Loyola Marymount University</a> Biomathematics Group, headed by <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/kdahlqui/index.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Kam Dahlquist</a>, and <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/bfitzpatrick/" target="_blank">Dr. Ben G. Fitzpatrick</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/" target="_blank">Dr. John David N. Dionisio</a>. The forerunner to GRNmap was initiated through a collaboration between Dr. Dahlquist and <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~etcamach/" target="_blank">Dr. Erika T. Camacho</a>, who co-mentored undergraduate Nathan C. Wanner (Applied Mathematics '07).  Dr. Ben G. Fitzpatrick joined the project in 2007 as part of the NSF-funded UBM (Interdisciplinary Training for Undergraduates in Biological and Mathematical Sciences; 0634613) Project where he and Dr. Dahlquist co-mentored Stephanie D. (Kuelbs) Entzminger (Applied Mathematics '09).  The project took its current form with an NSF-funded RUI award (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0921038" target="_blank">0921038</a>) to Drs. Dahlquist and Fitzpatrick, enabling work by students Alondra J. Vega (Biomathematics '12), Nicholas A. Rohacz (Biochemistry '13), and Katrina Sherbina (Biomathematics '14), and was christened GRNmap in September 2014 with the work of Juan S. Carrillo (Computer Science, Applied Mathematics '16).  Subsequent students joined either the coding or data analysis subgroups.  The current coding team includes Trixie Anne M. Roque (Computer Science '17) and Chukwuemeka (Eddie) Azinge (Computer Science '19).  The current data analysis team includes Natalie E. Williams (Biology '17), Kristen M. Horstmann (Biomathematics '17), Brandon J. Klein (Biology '18) and Magaret J. O’Neil (Biology '18), with recent contributions by Tessa A. Morris (Biomathematics '16), K. Grace Johnson (Biochemistry '17), and Kayla C. Jackson (Spelman College Mathematics '17).  GRNmap is featured as a project in the course Biology 398:  Biomathematical Modeling/Mathematics 388:  Survey of Biomathematics taught by Drs. Dahlquist and Fitzpatrick (see the <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BIOL398-01/S11" target="_blank">Spring 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BIOL398-03/S13" target="_blank">Spring 2013</a>, and <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BIOL398-04/S15" target="_blank">Spring 2015</a> course web sites).

                                                The mean squared error calculation for each individual gene in each strain is now produced in the optimization_diagnostics sheet instead of the sum of squares of error.

                                        GRNmap can now perform multiple successive runs for fine tuning of the optimization parameter, alpha. When L_curve is set to 1 in the optimization_parameters worksheet, GRNmap will complete 16 successive runs with the alpha values of 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.008, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0008, 0.0005, 0.0002, and 0.0001. The user supplied initial guesses are used for the first run; all subsequent runs use the output from the previous run as the initial guesses for that run. By plotting the least squared error against the penalty term (found in the optimization_diagnostics sheet of the output file), the user can create an L-curve by which the appropriate alpha value for future estimation runs can be determined from the "elbow" of the curve.

                                        The test suite has been updated to reflect recent changes in the package and now uses proper setUp and tearDown methods so that the tests can run faster.
                                    </li>

                                        The test files have been updated accordingly (i.e., variable names that are obsolete have been removed) after implementing the above changes.

                                GRNmap v1.0.2 includes the following new features and bug fixes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Some known bugs in v1.0 have been fixed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The code has been updated to be compatible with MATLAB 2014b. Version 1.0 would fail when generating graphs because the way that MATLAB treats figure handles had changed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        GRNmap now outputs individual worksheets containing the optimized expression values for each strain.
