                            Running GRNmap from Code:

                                    The GRNmap code was developed and tested with MATLAB R2014b; it may not function properly with other versions of MATLAB.

                                    GRNmap is only compatible with the Windows operating system because of the function it uses to read and write Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. It has only been tested on Windows 7.

                                    We recommend running GRNmap with a minimum of 8.00 GB of RAM and a 2.40 GHz processor. GRNmap may be compatible with slower systems; the amount of RAM and processor speed will affect the speed with which GRNmap completes the estimation.

                                    You must have administrator rights or have the MATLAB Runtime Compiler already installed in your machine to use the stand-alone executable.

                This sheet contains initial guesses for the production rate parameters, P, for all genes in the network. Assuming that the system is in steady state with the relative expression of all genes equal to 1, (P/2) - lambda = 0, where lambda is the degradation rate, is a reasonable initial guess. The sheet should contain three columns (from left to right) entitled, "SystematicName", "StandardName", and "production_rates". The SytematicName refers to the gene ID from the <a href='http://www.yeastgenome.org/'>Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)</a>, for example, YLR131C. The StandardName refers to the corresponding Standard Name for that gene from SGD, for example, ACE2. The "production_rates" column should then contain the initial guesses for the P parameter as described above.

                This sheet contains degradation rates for all genes in the network, which are provided by the user. Currently, the Dahlquist Lab is using data based on published protein half-life data from <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/103/35/13004'>Belle et al. (2006)</a>. We converted the half-life data values to the degradation rates by taking the natural log of the half-life and dividing by 2. The sheet should contain three columns (from left to right) entitled, "SystematicName", "StandardName", and "DegradationRate". The SytematicName refers to the gene ID from the <a href='http://www.yeastgenome.org/'>Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)</a>, for example, YLR131C. The StandardName refers to the corresponding Standard Name for that gene from SGD, for example, ACE2. The "DegradationRate" column should then contain the degradation rate as described above.

                <p>Expression data can be provided for multiple strains of yeast (for example, the wild type strain and a transcription factor deletion strain). Each strain will have its own sheet in the workbook. Each sheet should be given a unique name corresponding to the name of the strain and have the following columns in order:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        "SystematicName": list of all Systematic Names of the genes in the network. The Sytematic Name refers to the gene ID from the <a href='http://www.yeastgenome.org/'>Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)</a>, for example, YLR131C.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "StandardName": The Standard Names of all genes the genes in the network, corresponding to the Systematic Names above, for example, ACE2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The next series of columns should contain the log2 expression data for each gene at a given timepoint. the column header should be the time at which the data were collected, without any units. For example, the 15 minute timepoint would have a column header "15" and the 30 minute timepoint would have the column header "30". GRNmap supports replicate data for each of the timepoints. Replicate data for the same timepoint should be in columns immediately next to each other and have the same column headers. For example, three replicates of the 15 minute timepoint would have "15", "15", "15" as the column headers.

                    Adjacency matrix representation of the gene regulatory network. The columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors. A “1” means there is an edge connecting them and a “0” means that there is no edge connecting them.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The upper-left cell (A1) should contain the text “rows genes affected/cols genes controlling”. This text is there as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory relationships specified by the adjacency matrix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest of the first row should contain the names of the transcription factors that are controlling the other genes in the network, one transcription factor name per column.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest of the first column should contain the names of the target genes that are being controlled by the transcription factors heading each of the columns in the matrix, one target gene name per row.

                        The transcription factor names should correspond to the "StandardNames" in the other sheets in the workbook. They should be capitalized the same way and occur in the same order along the top and side of the matrix. The matrix needs to be symmetric, i.e., the same transcription factors should appear along the top and side of the matrix.

Again, the columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors.

                        simtime: A row containing a list of the time points when the data was collected experimentally. Should correspond to the timepoint column headers in the expression sheets.

                        Strain: A row containing a list of all of the strains for which there is expression data in the workbook. Should correspond to the names of the sheets for each strain.
                    </li>
                        Sheet: A row where each entry is the order number of the sheet (left to right) that corresponds to the list of strains above.
                    <li>
                        Deletion: Gives the index of the gene in the network sheet that has been deleted in each strain listed above. For example, if data has been provided for the CIN5 deletion strain, then give the index number from the network sheet corresponding to CIN5.

                This sheet has the same format as the “production_rates” sheet above. These are the initial guesses for the estimation of the b parameters. (note: double-check this claim about formatting).
